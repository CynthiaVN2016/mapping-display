In addition to the large contiguous display in the cafe itself, the same HDMI input is partially displayed on the square display panels in the hall of the Becton entrance. You task is to write a program to discover the mapping of screen space to physical space. Your program should be semi-automatic in that it may require human input. One example solution would be a program whereby clicking on the screen displays a single pixel and its coordinates. By clicking around the screen, you can discover critical points of the display, which you then record in your docs.

We will introduce the programming language Processing in class, but you are free to use any language of your choosing.

This task is a team project. You will need your team members in order to help map out the physical layout of pixels, as the HDMI connection is in a separate room than some of the display. You will need to work together (read, shout at each other through the halls) in order to build a map of the pixels. You may submit a single repository as long as each group member has at least one commit (for tracking purposes).

Deliverables:

(5 pts) Documentation that describes the mapping of pixels to physical space. You can express this as raw pixel values, or as display percentage values. You will be graded on the ability of a third party (who has never seen this display before) to understand the layout.
(5 pts) The program that you used to discover this mapping. You may choose to first find the rough mapping manually (eg moving your mouse around), then write the program, but the program should be sufficient to discover the mapping in a semi-automated way as well. This program can be run from a laptop (need not be the Raspberry Pi).
