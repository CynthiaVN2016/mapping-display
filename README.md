Based on the program that our team has created, we have mapped out the layout
of the Becton center LED panels. You can find all of the relevant
documentation in the "mapping" folder, which contains three resources.

a. "mapping.png"
	This image file shows the layout of the entire screen space, with the LED
	panels as numbered colored blocks. Each rectangle's number corresponds to
	the same one in text file "mapping_info.txt" which contains specific data
	about each rectangle. 
	
b. "mapping_info.txt"
	This text file contains information of the height and width of the
	rectangle, as well as the x/y coordinates of the top left corner of each
	rectangle. 

c. "physicalpanels.jpg"
	This series of images are of the physical LED panels outside of the Cafe.
	Each panel is labeled with the corresponding rectangle number in
	"mapping.png" and "mapping_info.txt".
